- **Before**: Direct DOM event listeners
- **After**: React event handlers with hooks

### 3. Routing
- **Before**: Hash-based routing with manual DOM manipulation
- **After**: React Router with declarative routing

### 4. Form Handling
- **Before**: Manual form submission with `preventDefault`
- **After**: React controlled components with state

### 5. Theme Management
- **Before**: Direct DOM class manipulation
- **After**: React context with useEffect for DOM updates

### 6. Internationalization
- **Before**: Manual DOM text updates
- **After**: Translation hook with reactive updates
